a shitty operating system coded entirely in assembly, got some basic features but not something crazy, will update when i have time.

Current features:
- Simple commands (list, delete, edit, cat)
- 3 games (Guessing game, Snake, Ping Pong (co-op))
- Networking (Ping, Curl)
- & More!

note that this is a simpel project of mine, it took me aprox 1 month to complete this OS.
